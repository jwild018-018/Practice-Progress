# Practice Tracker - Backlog

## Nice-to-haves (Post-Beta)

- [ ] **Edit athlete name** - Allow renaming athletes
- [ ] **Stripe integration** - Real Pro upgrade flow
- [ ] **Password reset flow** - Let users recover their account if they forget password
- [ ] **Edit existing practices** - Currently can only delete; add ability to modify date, duration, focus, notes
- [ ] **Onboarding tips for new users** - First-time walkthrough or tooltips explaining features
- [ ] **Push notifications / reminders** - Remind parents to log practice (e.g., "Did you practice today?")

## Ideas for Later

- [ ] Streak tracking (consecutive days/weeks practiced)
- [ ] Share progress reports (email or link)
- [ ] Team/coach view (multiple athletes across families)
- [ ] Practice templates (quick-log common routines)
- [ ] Photo/video attachments for practices
- [ ] Integration with calendar apps
